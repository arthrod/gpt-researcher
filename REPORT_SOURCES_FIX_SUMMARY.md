# Report Sources Formatting Fix - Summary

## Problem
The original code had issues with appending sources to reports:
1. Could produce malformed formatting by appending without ensuring trailing newlines
2. Risk of KeyError when accessing 'url' or 'id' keys that might be missing
3. Unsafe access to `cfg.append_sources` attribute that might not exist

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made in `/gpt_researcher/skills/writer.py` (lines 79-88)

**Before:**
```python
if self.researcher.cfg.append_sources and self.researcher.research_sources:
    lines = ["\n\nSources:\n"]
    for src in self.researcher.research_sources:
        title = src.get("title") or src["url"]  # Could raise KeyError
        lines.append(f"[{src['id']}] {title} - {src['url']}")  # Could raise KeyError
    report += "\n".join(lines)  # Could produce malformed formatting
```

**After:**
```python
if getattr(self.researcher.cfg, "append_sources", False) and self.researcher.research_sources:
    lines = ["", "", "Sources:", ""]
    for src in self.researcher.research_sources:
        url = src.get("url", "")
        title = src.get("title") or url
        src_id = src.get("id")
        if not url or src_id is None:
            continue  # Skip invalid sources
        lines.append(f"[{src_id}] {title} - {url}")
    report = report.rstrip() + "\n" + "\n".join(lines) + "\n"
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Safe Attribute Access**: Uses `getattr()` with default value to safely check `append_sources`
2. **Safe Key Access**: Uses `.get()` method with defaults to avoid KeyError
3. **Validation**: Skips sources with missing required fields (url or id)
4. **Consistent Formatting**: 
   - Strips trailing whitespace from report
   - Ensures consistent newline separation
   - Always ends with a single newline

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in `/tests/test_report_sources_formatting.py`:
- ✅ Proper newline formatting
- ✅ Handling sources with missing keys
- ✅ Respecting append_sources setting
- ✅ Safe attribute access
- ✅ Handling various report endings
- ✅ Empty sources list

All 6 tests pass successfully.

## Benefits

- **No More Formatting Issues**: Consistent newline separation between report and sources
- **No More KeyErrors**: Safe access to all dictionary keys
- **No More AttributeErrors**: Safe access to configuration attributes
- **Better Data Validation**: Invalid sources are skipped gracefully
- **Cleaner Output**: Properly formatted sources section with consistent spacing
